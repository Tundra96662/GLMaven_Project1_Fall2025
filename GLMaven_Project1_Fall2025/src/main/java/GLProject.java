	Description of HashMap: It implements a key-value storage system by using hashing.
	It also includes precautions to handle collisions by chaining the new key-value pairs to those
	already found in the bucket. Each bucket is made up of a linked list; that's how collision
	was avoided, and the linked list works as a queue. Keys in the same bucket are differentiated
	from one another by implementing codes. It is built using an 'iterator' which helps us
	iterate through all the values in the HashMap.
